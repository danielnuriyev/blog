### Rashi Script

Rashi Script is a Hebrew script used in printing [Rashi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi)'s commentary on [Tanakh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh) (the Hebrew Bible) and [Gemara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemara) (legal discussions based on Mishna - the fundamental legal work).

Since nowadays Rashi Script is used exclusively for Rashi's commentaries, most Hebrew speakers and some [Torah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism) students think that this is the script in which Rashi used to write.

The truth is that this script is called Rashi Script not because he wrote in it but because this script was chosen to print his commentary.

In 1516 in Venice, a Christian from [Antwerp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp) [Daniel Bomberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bomberg) printed Tanakh with Rashi's commentary. In order to distinguish between the text of Tanakh and the commentary, he printed them in different scripts. Tanakh was printed using the formal script common among the [Ashkenazi Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews) (Jews from the German lands), and the commentary was printed using the cursive script common among the [Sephardi Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews) (Jews expelled from Spain).
