# Names of the Hebrew Letters

Every of the 22 Hebrew letters has a name and each name has a meaning. In some cases the meaning is obvious. For example, the name of the second letter ב (bet) obviously means house. In some cases the meaning is obvious if you know Hebrew and related languages a bit deeper. In this case it is obvious that the first letter א (alef) means a bull. In other cases the meaning is obvious but may be wrong. For example, I was sure that the third letter ג (gimel) meant a camel but some linguists think that it was some kind of stick or weapon.

Now, why do the letters need names, and not just names but meaningful names? Why, for example, not to call the letter ז zayin just z because it is read as z. It is way simpler and therefore this is how it works in French, Russian, Turkish and in many other languages. The answer is that some letters have multiple pronunciations. For example ב can be read both as b and v. And some have no pronunciation at all! For example א has no sound! It is just a placeholder for a vowel.

But the real reason is not phonetic but historic. The present day Hebrew letters can be traced back to the 18th century BC Proto-Sinaitic letters, i.e. letters used on stone carvings in Sinai for a Canaanite language, i.e. a language closely related to Hebrew. In that alphabet, when they wanted to write a sound, they drew a common object that starts with that sound. For example when they wanted to write the sound b, they drew a house because in their language it sounded something like beth.

This is the origin of the letter names not only in modern Hebrew but in some other languages whose alphabets developed from Proto-Sinaitic script: Aramaic, Greek and maybe some other.
