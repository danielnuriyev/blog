# Hebrew Pronunciation: Overview

Hebrew is one of the most ancient continuously used languages. Hebrew belongs to the Canaanite group of languages. Canaanite languages were spoken in and around Canaan - the ancient name of the land of Israel. The most ancient inscriptions in a Canaanite languages date 3000 years back.

The Jewish religious history presents a different story. Hebrew in Hebrew is called ivrit - the language of [Eber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eber) (Ever) the only descendant of [Noah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah) who preserved the language of [Adam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam). The language was passed down to [Abraham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham) and through his son Isaac to Jacob (aka Israel) and all his descendants - the nation of Israel.

In both cases we have the text of [Torah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah) and those of us who observe and study it must know how to pronounce it correctly. Or not?

In the following brief articles I will outline the currently used Hebrew pronunciations and I will try to answer these questions:

-   what is the root of the currently used pronunciations
-   to what extent we can know the original pronunciation
-   is it important to use the original pronunciation in the religious context
