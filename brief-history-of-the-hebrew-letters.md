### Brief History of the Hebrew Letters

Letters that we use for Hebrew are [Aramaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language). The [original Hebrew letters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet) were replaced after the [Babylonian captivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) by the prophet [Ezra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra).

The original Hebrew letters:

The original Hebrew alphabet was called עברי or לִיבּוֹנָאָה in [Talmud Bavli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Talmud_Bavli_.28Babylonian_Talmud.29), דַעַץ\רעץ in [Talmud Yerushalmi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud). I do not know the origin of דעץ\רעץ. The origin of ליבונאה is also unknown, although, in my opinion, it may point to the Phoenician origin of the alphabet, since Phoenicians originated in Lebanon.\
The adopted Aramaic alphabet was named כתב אשורי, Assyrian writing, because it came from Assyria, not because it was used for writing the Assyrian language, a form of Akkadian, which was a language related to but different from Aramaic. Another name for this alphabet is כתב מרובע, square writing, because of the shape of its letters.\
It may seem strange that a prophet would replace the letters of the holy Torah by the letters of another language. But the explanation may be that he viewed the Aramaic letters merely as variations of the Hebrew letters, just as English has variations of the same letters such as lower and upper case, or the handwriting. After all, both languages had 22 letters and, speaking scientifically, they developed from the same original [Proto-Canaanite alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet), just as the various English letters and styles developed from the Latin script. Why Ezra did it? To make Torah more accessible to the Jews who spent 70 years in an Aramaic and Akkadian speaking environment.

Note: during the Babylonian Empire, the official language was the Babylonian form of Akkadian. Aramaic was the de-facto lingua franca. When Persians took over Babylonia and created the Persian Empire, Aramaic became the official language.

Has the original Hebrew alphabet disappeared? No. It is still used by [Samaritans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans), although their letters have slightly changed over time, as we see from archeology.

Samaritan alphabet:

And it is even still used by us! At least in one case: on the Israeli one shekel coin:

Every letter of the adopted Aramaic alphabet has precise specifications of how to write it, which is necessary for preservation of Torah. But even with the specifications, there are four styles: beys yosef, ari, sefaradi, teymoni.

This picture shows some of them:

And, besides the letters with crowns that are used for Torah, we have letters without crowns, the "Rashi" script, the handwritten script, various modern print and  computer fonts.

Rashi script:

Now, given the fact that our present day Torah is not written in the original letters, and given the fact that this has been known all along, I do not understand how the shapes of the adopted Aramaic letters can be ascribed mystical meanings. But, I guess, "much to learn I still have" :)

Sources:\
We know about the original letters from numerous archeological findings in and around Israel. The earliest Jewish religious source that mentions the change of letters is Talmud.\
