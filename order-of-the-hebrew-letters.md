### Order of the Hebrew Letters

The current Hebrew alphabet has developed from the 18 century BC[  Proto-Sinaitic script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script).

We do not know the order of the Proto-Sinaitic script. But we do know the order of the Ugaritic alphabet. Uragitic, like Hebrew, was a Semitic language. Its letters are based on Sumer[  cuneiform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform), not on the[  Egyptian pictographs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs) as in the Proto-Sinaitic script. But the order of the Ugaritic letters is similar to what we later see in alphabets developed from Proto-Sinaitic, such as Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.

Ugaritic letters on a tablet found in Ugarit:

This is a good explanation and correlation between Hebrew and Ugaritic: <http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/22_alphabet.html>
